## Controller rulings

1. Existing ScoreV2 and balanced-signal plans remain historical implementation evidence. Their real-data-only, paper-only, conservative same-bar, and validator-ownership rules remain binding.
2. Their old `ARMED`-requires-trigger semantics are superseded only in Lifecycle V2 shadow work; current model behavior is preserved until Golden Corpus and OOS gates pass.
3. No Production DB, backup, migration, deployment, restart, Telegram message, live trading, or merge is authorized.
4. The canonical fixture corpus is not a substitute for real-data replay, OOS evidence, or the legacy-runtime corpus.
5. W1-A is contract vocabulary only: no active consumer imports/cutover, no ScoreV2/lifecycle/ranking/execution semantic change.
6. A green quality gate does not by itself clear static-analysis findings; substantive findings must be inspected, fixed, or explicitly adjudicated before `MERGE_READY`.
7. W1-B is split into B1 foundation and B2 schema-ownership cutover. W1-C cannot begin until B2 is independently verified.
8. Branch synchronization inside the development stack does not constitute `MERGE_APPROVAL` and must not merge any PR or update `main`.

## Wave 0 review evidence

- Draft PR: #22.
- Backend: 346 passed; 9 pre-existing deprecation warnings.
- Frontend: Node 26 typecheck and production build passed.
- Dependency audit: backend, watchdog, and npm passed with zero known findings and no audit exceptions.
- Artifact parity: Python 3.13 and Node 26 declarations match digest-only image inputs; container validation passed.
- Independent analysis: SonarCloud initially found seven issues; all were fixed without suppressions and the rerun quality gate passed. CodeQL reported no new alerts.
- Model impact: no scoring, threshold, lifecycle, trigger, or execution-level changes; canonical fixture replay remained exact.
- Remaining hard gate: legacy-runtime evidence capture requires separate Production authorization before model-affecting work.

## Wave 1A canonical-contract evidence

- Draft stacked PR: #23.
- Base: `program/wave0-foundations-v1` at `497ed954b09c158fcbf02df47a0f196eda5d61ab`.
- Verified code/test head before this ledger-only commit: `b0ddfa6de937841296b46107e6990a10b135ba5e`.
- Model impact classification: `SEMANTIC_INFRA`.
- Active consumer cutover: none.
- Production mutation: none.

### TDD RED evidence

1. Initial vocabulary RED: `3 failed, 346 passed` — intentionally missing `waterfallhunter.core.contracts`.
2. Signal/execution packet RED: `5 failed, 349 passed` — absent `SignalDecisionPacket` / `ExecutionPlan` contracts.
3. Position/notification RED: `5 failed, 354 passed` — absent `PositionState`, `PositionAmendment`, and `NotificationEvent`.
4. Contract identity review RED: `2 failed, 361 passed` — mismatched `contract_type` / `contract_version` accepted before fix.
5. Deep-immutability / payload-security review RED: `3 failed, 363 passed` — nested validated data remained mutable and delivery/secret payload keys were not fully rejected.
6. Concatenated/plural secret-key review RED: `7 failed, 366 passed` — `apitoken`, `accesstoken`, `authtoken`, `bearertoken`, `usersecret`, `tokens`, and `credentials` passed before hardening.

### Final verification at `b0ddfa6...`

- Backend full suite: `374 passed, 9 warnings`.
- Runtime parity: `runtime declarations are aligned`.
- Frontend Node 26 typecheck and production build: passed.
- Dependency audit: Python and npm jobs passed.
- Container validation: revision-labelled production artifacts built; exact backend artifact family tested; OCI revision labels verified.
- Repository hygiene/secret scan: passed.
- SonarQube Cloud: quality gate passed; `0 New issues`; `0 Security Hotspots`; no accepted/suppressed issue required.
- CodeRabbit: substantive findings on deep immutability, payload field isolation, and concatenated secret-like keys were fixed. All inline review threads are resolved. The latest completed incremental source review (`36a60af...` → `b69c3df...`) generated no actionable comments.
- Additional review coverage: explicit tests now cover non-finite JSON numbers, non-string object keys, and unsupported container values.
- Manual security diff scope: canonical contract code introduces validation/serialization only; no network/file/subprocess/credential/order-execution path and no active consumer cutover.
- Model semantic diff: none expected or accepted; no active scoring/lifecycle/ranking/execution behavior was modified.

### Wave 1A controller state

`W1-A = MERGE_READY_PENDING_MERGE_APPROVAL`.

This is an evidence state only. PR #23 remains Draft and unmerged. `MERGE_APPROVAL` has not been granted.

## Wave 1B1 migration/readiness foundation evidence

- Draft stacked PR: #24.
- Base branch: `feat/wave1a-canonical-contracts-v1`.
- Pre-stack-sync implementation head: `a57e92b693302531a56cfcdede164b2c62ce48c3`.
- Model impact classification: `SEMANTIC_INFRA`.
- Runtime schema-ownership cutover: none; reserved for W1-B2.
- Production migration/readiness probe: never executed.

### Implemented B1 scope

- first-party packaged migration discovery and canonical `NNNN_name.sql` identity;
- exact-byte SHA-256 migration checksums;
- immutable `schema_migrations` history with update/delete blockers;
- `PRAGMA user_version` consistency and fail-closed state verification;
- per-migration atomic transaction and rollback;
- dedicated `db_readiness_probe` migration only;
- rollback-only deep readiness primitive with bounded busy timeout;
- optional integrity/FK checks, zero-residue verification, and typed `require_ready()` failure;
- schema-ownership inventory for the later B2 cutover.

### TDD / hardening evidence

- discovery foundation RED: missing migration module/package;
- runner RED: `6 failed, 370 passed` before `MigrationRunner` implementation;
- readiness RED: `8 failed, 376 passed` before `db_readiness` implementation;
- hardening RED: `2 failed, 393 passed` for migration identity/filename mismatch and missing-parent directory auto-creation;
- all B1 tests were green at `a57e92b...` before the W1A base advanced.

### Pre-sync verification at `a57e92b...`

- Backend full suite: `395 passed, 9 warnings`.
- Runtime parity: aligned.
- Frontend, dependency audit, container validation, and repository hygiene: passed.

### Wave 1B1 remaining gates

1. synchronize the stacked branch with the final reviewed W1A head without merging any PR;
2. rerun full first-party CI on the synchronized head;
3. run CodeRabbit/Sonar/security review on the synchronized PR diff and fix/adjudicate valid findings;
4. update B1 evidence only after those gates pass.

`W1-B1` is not yet declared merge-ready, and W1-B2/W1-C remain blocked.
